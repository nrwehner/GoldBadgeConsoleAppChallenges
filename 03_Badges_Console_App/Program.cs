Komodo Insurance
Komodo Insurance is fixing their badging system.

Here's what they need:
An app that maintains a dictionary of details about employee badge information. (Hint: A dictionary is a collection type in C#. You'll want to use that.)

Essentially, an badge will have a badge number that gives access to a specific list of doors. For instance, a developer might have access to Door A1 & A5. A claims agent might have access to B2 & B4.

Your task will be to create the following:
A badge class that has the following properties:
BadgeID
List of door names for access
A badge repository that will have methods that do the following:
Create a dictionary of badges.
The key for the dictionary will be the BadgeID.
The value for the dictionary will be the List of Door Names.
 

The Program will allow a security staff member to do the following:
create a new badge
update doors on an existing badge.
delete all doors from an existing badge.
show a list with all badge numbers and door access, like this:
Here are some views:

Out of scope:
You do not need to consider tying an individual badge to a particular user. Just the Badge # will do.

Be sure to Unit Test your Repository methods.
